## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Life Expectancy dataset** from the World Health Organization (WHO), covering health data from **179 countries** worldwide between **2000-2015**. 

The analysis focuses on understanding:
- How economic factors (GDP) influence life expectancy
- The role of education (schooling) in population health
- Impact of vaccination programs on mortality rates
- Differences between developed and developing nations
- Building predictive models using machine learning

### Objectives:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand data distributions, correlations, and patterns
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate public health theories (e.g., Preston Curve)
3. **Machine Learning**: Build accurate life expectancy prediction models
4. **Policy Insights**: Provide actionable recommendations for health policymakers

## Research Questions

The project investigates **7 meaningful questions**:

| # | Question | Focus Area |
|---|----------|------------|
| 1 | Why did life expectancy trends 2000–2015 vary across countries and regions? | Regional Analysis |
| 2 | What are the key factors to improve longevity growth? | Factor Analysis |
| 3 | How to assess factor importance and build accurate prediction models? | Machine Learning |
| 4 | Schooling vs. GDP: Which drives life expectancy more? (Preston Curve) | Economic Analysis |
| 5 | What factors help poor countries achieve high life expectancy? | Development Paradox |
| 6 | What factors are needed to reduce infant mortality? | Child Health |
| 7 | How do lifestyle factors (Alcohol, BMI) impact life expectancy? | Paradox of Affluence |

---

## Key Findings

### 1. The Preston Curve Validated
- GDP has **logarithmic relationship** with life expectancy (diminishing returns)
- **Saturation point**: ~$20,000 GDP per capita beyond which additional wealth has minimal impact
- In developing countries, **education has 2x higher impact** than GDP on life expectancy

### 2. Vaccination > Economic Growth for Child Survival
- Correlation: Vaccination vs. Mortality Reduction = **-0.43** (moderate-strong)
- Correlation: GDP Growth vs. Mortality Reduction = **-0.11** (weak)
- Poor countries with >90% vaccination coverage achieve mortality rates comparable to upper-middle-income nations

### 3. Machine Learning Model Performance
- **Random Forest Regressor** achieved excellent predictive accuracy
- Top predictive features: Under-five deaths (73.8%), Adult mortality (22.8%)
- **Stratified sampling by region** crucial for unbiased model evaluation

### 4. The "Low GDP Overachiever" Phenomenon
- Some poor countries achieve life expectancy comparable to rich nations
- Key success factors: High vaccination coverage (88.6% vs 91.1% in rich countries), low alcohol consumption, effective HIV control
- Geographic concentration: Asia and Central America produce most "overachievers"

### 5. Global Health Inequality Patterns
- Extreme right skew in GDP and HIV data reflects real-world disparities
- Africa faces "geographical penalty": tropical diseases, conflict, climate
- Education is a long-term investment; emergency health interventions yield faster returns

2. Install the Python and Jupyter extensions
3. Navigate to the `src/` folder

### Execution Order

| `01_data_exploration.ipynb` | Data loading and exploration | Dataset information, data quality checks, preprocessing |
| `02_meaningful_questions.ipynb` | Research analysis | Analysis of 7 research questions with visualizations |
| `03_project_summary.ipynb` | Summary and reflections | Key findings, limitations, future directions |

**Steps:**
1. Open and run `01_data_exploration.ipynb` first
2. Then run `02_meaningful_questions.ipynb`
3. Finally run `03_project_summary.ipynb`

> **Note:** Each notebook must be run in order as later notebooks may depend on insights or data structures established in earlier ones.
